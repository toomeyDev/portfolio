            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Recent computer science graduate from Worcester State University, 
                with a concentration in software development. I've been coding in 
                Java for the past eight years, and enjoy experimenting with a variety
                of languages in my spare time. In particular I've recently been working
                a lot in Python which has been a great learning experience compared to
                the stricter conventions of Java, and a lot of the projects I feature on
                this site were developed in Python due to it's ease of use and fantastic libraries
                for pretty much anything I can throw at it.
